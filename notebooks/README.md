# EthioMart NER Project

## Overview
EthioMart is on a mission to become the primary hub for all Telegram-based e-commerce activities in Ethiopia. As the popularity of Telegram for business transactions grows, our goal is to consolidate independent e-commerce channels into a single, centralized platform. This will enable vendors and customers to interact seamlessly, enhancing product discovery, order placement, and communication.
