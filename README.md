# EthioMart NER Project

## Overview
EthioMart is on a mission to become the primary hub for all Telegram-based e-commerce activities in Ethiopia. As the popularity of Telegram for business transactions grows, our goal is to consolidate independent e-commerce channels into a single, centralized platform. This will enable vendors and customers to interact seamlessly, enhancing product discovery, order placement, and communication.

## Project Description
This project focuses on fine-tuning Large Language Models (LLMs) for an Amharic Named Entity Recognition (NER) system. The NER system will extract key business entities such as product names, prices, and locations from text, images, and documents shared across various Telegram channels.

### Key Features
- **Real-time Data Extraction**: Automatically extract entities from messages and media shared in Telegram channels.
- **Centralized Database**: Populate EthioMartâ€™s database with extracted data for easy access and management.
- **Multi-channel Integration**: Aggregate data from multiple e-commerce Telegram channels into one unified platform.
